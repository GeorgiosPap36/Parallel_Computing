# Parallel_Computing

This repository contains the solutions developed for the master's course Parallel Computational Systems. The projects involve using a variety of libraries (OpenMP, Pthreads, and MPI) and techniques to parallelize tasks and compare the performance of parallel algorithms with their serial counterparts. The code is structured to demonstrate the application of key parallel computing concepts and techniques covered throughout the course.

## Project 1
The first project consisted of 4 questions

### Question 1
The goal of this question was to calculate an approximation of Pi using the Monte Carlo method and compare performance of the parallel algorithm to the serial one. Files: er1_openmp.c, er1_pthreads.c and er1_serial.c.
