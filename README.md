## Parallel_Computing

This repository contains the solutions developed for the master's course Parallel Computational Systems. The projects involve using a variety of libraries (OpenMP, Pthreads, and MPI) and techniques to parallelize tasks and compare the performance of parallel algorithms with their serial counterparts. The code is structured to demonstrate the application of key parallel computing concepts and techniques covered throughout the course.
